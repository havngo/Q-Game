## Q Questions

1. When exchanging tiles the rules mention that "The returned tiles are added to the end of the refereeâ€™s collection". Does this mean that the returned tiles won't be drawn until the tiles in front are drawn?

2. Can the player keep playing if they cheat or send an improper tile placement request?

3. If a player plays a two tiles on a row of three, previous to the move, then does that player get 2 point for their placed tile, and 3 points for having placed on a row of 3?
